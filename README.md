# PrinterBilling

This is an example of a script that I wrote in Python in order to help automate billing that I had to do for printer usage at an office where I worked. The printer we had generated a CSV file that was a flat database containing users and the number of prints they had for a given time period. The script helped me by parsing this file, removing unnecessary columns and rows, sorting records and most importantly calculating the charges.

## Usage

    $ printerbilling.py file1 file2
